2. NLP and Machine Learning Capabilities

Text Classification Models: Use models like BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT fine-tuned for fake news detection.

Semantic Analysis: Detect subtle differences in truthfulness through context and tone.

Stance Detection: Assess whether a given article supports or contradicts a known fact.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify people, places, and organizations for cross-referencing.
